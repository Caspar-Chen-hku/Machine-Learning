# Machine-Learning
Some ML programs written in Jupyter Notebook

## Introduction
Why machine learning?
Problems that machine learning can solve

## KNN implemented from scratch

Introduction
This program makes use of the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset** and use **KNN** to predict breast cancer in the test dataset. The total accuracy rate is also calculated, with graphics displayed to show the accuracy of KNN algorithm

Main features
- data preprocessing: data normalization, crucial features are found out to help predict more accurately
- Different variations are tried, such as:
1. different values of k
2. weighted voting of nearest neighbors
3. data split in different ways
4. Filter out the neighbors that are too far away
5. elminate the case where two qually-weighted predictions are present
